% A17231193 MATLAB code for A17231193.fig
%      A17231193, by itself, creates a new A17231193 or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = A17231193 returns the handle to a new A17231193 or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      A17231193('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in A17231193.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      A17231193('Property','Value',...) creates a new A17231193 or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before A17231193_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to A17231193_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
